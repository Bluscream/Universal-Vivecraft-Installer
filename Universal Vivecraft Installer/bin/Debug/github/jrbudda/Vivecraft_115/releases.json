Currently includes Optifine pre-15.\r\n\r\nNew in Vivecraft 1.15v3:\r\n - Forge is supported. We are also doing a optiforge-style re-processing of coremods so compatibility might actually be better than just optifine.\r\n - Calibrated height is handled a bit differently, player height may be off if mixing v3 and v2 players.",

Can no longer teleport or walk-up off of a honey block. Slowing blocks (honey, soulsand, cobwebs) will also limit horizontal teleport reach.\r\n\r\nInitial release (4/12/2020)\r\n - re-enabled 3rd person height scaling based on calibrated height (clamped at 50% to 150%)\r\n - Arms in 3rd person should not move with height scale, 1st- and 3rd-person arm positions should match exactly with world always.\r\n - Re-did shoulder rotations so textures line up with vanilla. I hope. Shoulders should track arm position but not rotate inwards at all.\r\n - Enabled custom rendering for seated players. Will show patreon HMD and follow head movement. Body and height should be vanilla.\r\n - Animations work on bungeecord server networks now, the bungee proxy server needs the [bungee extensions](https://github.com/Techjar/Vivecraft_BungeeCord_Extensions/releases) plugin in addition to our normal spigot plugin on each server.\r\n - All SVRI actions that were mandatory are now suggested.\r\n - improve shoulder animations\r\n - improve 3rd person trident \r\n - fix player shadow disappearing if you're a tiny boi\r\n - fix 3rd person hands moving down when sneaking.\r\n - fix optifine FXAA causing opengl errors after window resize.\r\n ",

Appear like inventory instead.\r\n - Fix window mode not resizing buffers.\r\n - Adjusted roomscale attacking reach. Now only have extended reach vs non-players. Slightly increased default reach. You should accidentally kill your friends less.\r\n - Chat window no longer closes on send when in standing mode.\r\n\r\nr4 (4/4/2020)\r\n - Actually fix roomscale bow angles with Index. Major internal change.\r\n - Fix entities not having shadows with shaders\r\n - Fix haptics on radial menu\r\n - Fix keyboard not opening automatically when editing a sign.\r\n - Fix spinning when you stop controlling a saddled pig.\r\n - Increase hysteresis for backpack-item-switching gesture\r\n\r\nr3 (4/3/2020)\r\n - Fix roomscale bow angles with Index/Touch. Hopefully for the last time.\r\n\r\nr2 (4/3/2020)\r\n - we dont talk about r2.\r\n\r\nInitial release (4/3/2020)\r\n\r\n - Updated to MC 1.15.2, Optifine G1-preview12\r\n - Rewrote first-person item positioning to base off the vanilla first_person_right_hand transforms. Now if you see something that is not positioned correctly, changing this transform in the resource pack json will affect vivecraft.\r\n - Improved 3rd person VR arm/shoulder rendering. Improved means *better*, not necessarily *good*\r\n - Fixed changing world scale would make the player move in the world, sometimes significantly.\r\n - Added some support for firing crossbows and tridents from the off-hand using the off-hand aim.\r\n - Added a cropped desktop mirror mode. F5 now also cycles mirror modes at any time and the mirror mode is show on the mirror. Mirror mirror.\r\n - The mixed-reality mirror has been disabled for now, it needs a re-write and is a ton of work for the number of people using it.\r\n\r\nForge does not work for now. We intend to add forge support to this version as soon as Optifine is compatible.",
