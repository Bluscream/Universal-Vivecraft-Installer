    "Body": "<details><summary>Initial Release Notes</summary>\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Added new in-game keyboard to replace the awful and buggy SteamVR keyboard.\r\n  * Works like the old keyboard, clicking on a text field should bring it up automatically.\r\n  * Pressing the combo (left grip + left appmenu or left hand trigger + Y) will bring it up any time.\r\n  * You can type with both hands!\r\n  * You cannot use the thumbpad like with SteamVR. You have to point n click. There may be a touch-based keyboard in the future.\r\n  * Keys are pressed with whichever button *type* is mapped to 'gui left click' or 'gui right click'. This means the triggers and touchpads by default. (Or index triggers and A/X if you swing that way)\r\n  * Holding 'gui shift' (default: left grip / left hand grip) switches to caps. You can also just point and click on 'Shift' to toggle to caps mode.\r\n* Added customizable radial menu for quickly pressing infrequently used keybinds. \r\n  * You get 2 sets of 8 keybinds to map.\r\n  * Find the config screen in VR Settings > Radial Menu... Must be in Standing play mode.\r\n  * Switch between the 2 sets by holding 'gui shift' (default: left grip) with the menu showing.\r\n  * Comes in 2 modes, HOLD and PRESS. \r\n    *  in HOLD mode you hold the button, hover over the selection and release. This is the default. \r\n    *  In PRESS mode, the button opens the menu until pressed again, buttons respond to normal click.\r\n* Added roomscale horse riding. And then removed it, temporarily.\r\n* Improved roomscale boat rowing mechanics.

    "Body": "## Alpha Builds (1/6 - 3/11/2018)\r\n\r\nNew Mirror Mode \r\n - Added '3rd person' mirror mode. Uses Mixed Reality Camera positioning and renders vanilla player. More to come on this mode. See [here](http://www.vivecraft.org/mixed-reality-cam/) for how to position the camera.\r\n - Removed 1/3 framerate mirror modes as they are pointless and clog up the menu.\r\n - F5 now cycles thru mirror modes.\r\n - Render a small window showing the desktop mirror next to the 'camera' widget using 3rd person or MR mirror node. Allows you to see yourself in-headset.\r\n\r\nSteamVR\r\n - Update OpenVR wrapper from 1.0.5 to 1.0.12, Make sure you're on a main SteamVR branch.\r\n - Fix controllers not working at all when steamvr render model interface is out to lunch.\r\n - Fix xbox controllers being detected as 3rd tracked controller (thanks Valve!)\r\n - Singleplayer games should now pause when opening the SteamVR dashboard or keyboard.\r\n - Steamvr keyboard no longer opens automatically when you sleep, (since it now pauses the game)\r\n - Fix openvr natives not being installed if your game directory was on the drive root (i.e. C:\\DW20\\)\r\n - Fix crash using Riftcat or similar and not being in 'seated' mode.\r\n - Fix controllers not showing up or working if game is started before they are tracking in SteamVR.\r\n\r\nLocomotion\r\n - The 'walk up blocks' locomotion setting now applies to normal movement, not just roomscale, and supercedes the vanilla 'autojump' setting. Kangaroo Sim VR has been discontinued.\r\n - Added option to disable roomscale bow entirely or just for mod items. Requires updated server plugin for multiplayer.\r\n - Fix unexpected influence of crosshair pointing direction when starting a jump while sprinting.\r\n\r\nInstaller\r\n - Can now choose custom Forge version during install. This voids the warranty.\r\n - Update MultiMC compatibility for 0.6.0+\r\n - Fix installer not displaying custom profile name on final popup.\r\n\r\nRendering\r\n - Fix 'entity outlines' from spectral arrow or glowing poition/effect totally breaking rendering.\r\n - 3rd person and shaders shadow rendering now uses the multiplayer model of yourself so you can see arm movements.\r\n - Improve 'end portal' render to not break your brain\r\n - Crosshair now lays flat when on a block in range.\r\n - Fixed player shadow location with shaders\r\n - Improved effects for player on fire.\r\n - Force GUI scale to 'large' always. Fixes gui's too small for non-unicode languages.\r\n - Fix mipmap/blur issue causing shimmery leaves and other texture problems in right eye when holding an item.\r\n - Fix some held blocks and items losing their color during the 'fade in' when switching items.\r\n\r\nForge \r\n - Update Forge to 2624\r\n - fix crashes with \r\n  -- Betterfoliage\r\n  -- LittleTiles\r\n  -- RandomThings\r\n  -- CubicChunks\r\n  -- Maybe some others.\r\n\r\n## Beta Builds\r\n\r\nBeta1 (3/12/2018)\r\n - Update Optifine to C9.\r\n\r\nBeta2 (3/12/2018)\r\n - Fix Hide HUD (F1) not working right.\r\n - Fix main menu cursor being really weird in standing mode with always follows: on and a high world rotation setting.\r\n - Fix shaders sky oddities with 3rd person or MR mirror on.\r\n - Fix patreon HMDs always being black (oops sorry?)\r\n\r\n## Final Builds\r\n\r\nFinal (3/16/2018)\r\n - Nothing. Nada. Just ship it.\r\n\r\nFinal R1 (3/18/2018)\r\n - Fix water rendering glitch in 3rd person mirror mode\r\n - Make camera hotkeys repeat when held down.\r\n\r\nFinal R2 (3/20/2018)\r\n - Don't send server-wide chat messages when cycling mirror modes with F5. No one cares, dude. What you do on your own desktop is your business.\r\n\r\nFinal R3 (3/25/2018)\r\n - Force download controller transforms all the time cause sometimes Rift's don't send controller track/untrack events. Fixes Rift arm/pointing direction being off if game started with without controllers tracking.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nNON-VR 7 Beta\r\n - Update to Optifine C7 and Forge 2583.\r\n - Can now choose custom Forge version during install.

    "Body": "### LAN play is now supported with animations!\r\nYes! Finally LAN play has animation support just like the server plugins!\r\n - Either Vivecraft or the Non-VR companion client can act as host. \r\n - Animations and VR positioning is fully supported.\r\n - Works with Forge too!\r\n - Correctly handles VR issues like enderman aggro, creeper radius, teleporting, etc. But does not have the same configurability of the server plugins.\r\n - Supports the [Patreon Rewards](https://www.patreon.com/jrbudda)\r\n\r\n### VR Data Code Overhaul\r\nRewrote how VR and Minecraft positioning data interact: this has opened the path to the following improvements:\r\n - Smooth Rotation: you can turn the 'rotation increment' slider all the way down to 'smooth' now. I nearly threw up no less than 3 times bringing you this feature. It's fixed-speed for now, but expect variable speed in the future if you have the rotate button mapped to something with an axis.\r\n - Vehicles\r\n    - You are no longer 'locked' into a vehicle. When you board or mount one, you will be moved to it but then you are free to peer over the side or walk away from it. Remember you must press 'sneak' (left grip) to dismount.\r\n    - A new 'Vehicle Rotation' option has been added and is on by default, Vehicles that you do not directly control (minecarts, boats, unsaddled horses) will rotate your view as they turn. I have been wanting to get this working for a long while now and I am super happy about it.\r\n   - Controllable, living mounts, like saddled horses have much better cosmetic display and rotation based on your actions.\r\n    - Roomscale Rowing is now much nicer (and yes, I finally caved in and made it row the way you're looking, let's just call it a magic rowboat)\r\n   - Firing a bow or other projectile while mounted and/or moving should now always fire in the expected direction and has a much lower chance of accidentally hitting the mount.\r\n - GUIs\r\n    - Gui's should now always render in the right place and not fly away if you change scale or rotation. Look for a GUI/HUD scaling option in the near future.\r\n   - Vanilla GUI's should no longer be sensitive to the size of the desktop window. I cannot say the same for Forge mod GUIs. If you play modded best to leave the window at default size (1280x720), or at the very least at a 16:9 aspect ratio.\r\n - Climbing\r\n   - Vines are actually roomscale-climbable now as they were always supposed to be.\r\n   - You can now climb sideways on ladders and vines and you will be slightly pulled towards them when you start climbing so you don't get stuck just a *little* too far away to comfortably climb.\r\n   - Collision detection for ladders and vines is now much better, you should accidentally let go much less often. Pro Tip: Hold 'sneak' while climbing and you won't fall even if you let go.\r\n   - Getting off at the top of blocks is now a little easier.\r\n   - Collisions while climbing no longer stop you dead, you will still move in any other unobstructed directions and you will get a light buzz in your controllers to indicate your grip is slipping.\r\n\r\n### VR Input Re-work\r\n - Switch from old state-driven code to proper fancy event-driven code. This means absolutely nothing to the player assuming its working correctly.\r\n - New binding menu to map MC functions to one, or several, controller buttons.\r\n - Can switch touchpads between several different split modes with up to 8 buttons per pad.\r\n\r\n### Other new or changed stuff\r\n - Update to Forge 2252. Maybe selectable builds in the future.\r\n - Experiment with a different, newer java garbage collector. if you find the game pauses on a regular interval, usually every 10-60 seconds when it did not before. You may want to try reverting to the previous garbage collector. To do this, edit your JVM args in the advanced profile settings in the launcher and replace `XX:+UseG1GC ` with\r\n`-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode -XX:-UseAdaptiveSizePolicy -Xmn256M`\r\n - Better MultiMC compatibility.  Vivecraft can be installed directly to a [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) instance. See [http://www.vivecraft.org/multimc/](here) for instructions. \r\n - Rework of the VR Settings menu. Moved all the 'Roomscale' options to the 'VR Interactions...\" menu to free up space in the locomotion menu. Removed some non-functional options. Made 'HUD Transparency' option work.\r\n - Backpack switching changes:\r\n   - Can now be toggled on and off in the VR Interactions menu.\r\n   - Left hand function has changed since it was not working correctly server-side. Doing the backpack motion with the left hand now swaps items between your hands. Right hand still switches to/from slot 1.\r\n - the openvr native dll's are unpacked on-demand now, allows us to update them in the future without breaking older installed versions\r\n - Add blue tint while underwater. Reduce Walkabout darkness tint.\r\n - HUD/GUI and Crosshair rendering changes\r\n   - These elements should now respond to the local brightness level. \r\n   - Neither should ever be too bright or dark to use. \r\n   - Both should now interact sensibly with water and your hands while following their respective occlusion setting. \r\n   - These features should work with, and without, shader packs. \r\n   - Note the shoulds.\r\n\r\n### Fixes for bugs I will admit to\r\n - Fix JEI not responding to mouse clicks, possibly fix other Forge GUI issues.\r\n - Fix 'shift' getting stuck on if you closed a GUI with it pressed.\r\n - Fix crash with JustTheTips mod.\r\n - Fix some glitchy bits with VR player rendering.\r\n - Fix some transparency issues while sneaking or attacking. Sneaking now causes both arms and the HUD to go slightly transparent.\r\n - Fix clicking on the Mojang copyright on the main menu sending you to an inescapable hell of eternal credit scroll.\r\n - Fix a virtual 'esc' not being sent when pressing the menu button for Touch users.\r\n - Fix the crosshair in seated mode drifting down if the window vertical resolution was odd.\r\n - Fix joy/pad movement setting affecting the game while in teleport mode.\r\n - Fix Roomscale rowing being active while aiming a bow\r\n - Fix Roomscale mining being active with a sword equipped.\r\n\r\n\r\nRC2 Update (11/24/2017 7PM EST)\r\n - Add experimental Windows MR controller-specific controller type and options\r\n - Fix a significant shader bug.\r\n\r\nRC3 Update (11/26/2017 12PM EST)\r\n - Fix crash on load if steamvr fails to initialize.\r\n - Fix vehicle rotation being forced on.\r\n - Switch back to old garbage collector flags since reports are not good.\r\n - More fixes for Windows MR controllers. Add stick deadzone setting.\r\n\r\nRC4 Update (11/29/2017 8PM EST)\r\n - Fix 'walk multiplier from doing *very* strange things.\r\n - Fix Mixed Reality cam mode.\r\n - Fix extended block reach distance from Forge mods not working.\r\n - Movement is now analog if the 'walk forward' button is mapped to something that is, in fact, analog (trigger, joystick, etc)\r\n - Autojump now defaults to off. This will be replaced shortly.\r\n - Misc fixes to keybinding code.\r\n\r\nRC5 Update (12/4/2017 3AM EST)\r\n - Many fixes to analog movement mode. Now applies to all 4 bindings (forwards, backwards, left right). Also can now be toggled off in settings. Also now uses configurable deadzone. You should still use joy/pad mode if you want full analog control tho.\r\n - Fix seated mode.\r\n - Fix some crashes\r\n - Fix profiler not showing up\r\n - Fix some more minor gui issues.\r\n - Update included Forge to 14.23.1.2559\r\n\r\nFinal (12/4/2017 10AM)\r\n - Fix few last little movement bugs.\r\n\r\nR1 Update (12/4/2017 10PM)\r\n - Fix some height issues using the NONVR client.\r\n\r\nR2 Update (12/8/2017 7AM)\r\n - Fix bows shooting backwards in seated mode.\r\n - Allow roomscale archery with bow equipped in offhand slot. In this case you must manually equip an arrow in the main hand.\r\n - Add press-to-bind function for controller mapping.\r\n - Better sync mining/placing reach distance with server.\r\n\r\nR3 Update (12/18/2017 6PM)\r\n - Fix crash if 'chat' button was bound to mouse.\r\n - try some maybe better default JVM args to combat GC stuttering.",

If you need to use this version: manually download and install Optifine 1.12 C4, then copy/rename the downloaded Optifine jar over top of the installed Optifine jar in .minecraft/libraries/optifine/OptiFine/1.12_HD_U_C4/OptiFine-1.12_HD_U_C4.jar\r\n\r\n\r\nr3 update: fix potential crash if something unloaded the sound system.\r\nr2 update: default to old menu room if low RAM allocation. Slightly shrink installer window.\r\nr1 update: fix crash with BetterFoliage mod\r\n\r\n### New Installer options:\r\n - Custom Profile Name: ticking this in the installer will allow you to enter a custom profile name. This means you can install the same version of Vivecraft multiple times with different options and not overwrite the one profile.\r\n - Modpack Directory - ticking this allows you to set the profile's 'Game Directory' during installation. This is the preferred way to play Vivecraft with a modpacks (such as from the FTB/Curse/Twitch launcher). Previously you would have to install Vivecraft and then edit the profile settings in the launcher, now it can be done during installation.\r\n\r\n### Onward-style joystick/touchpad analog movement:\r\n\r\nVR Settings > Locomotion Settings > Freemove Type > Set to 'Joy/Pad'\r\n\r\n - Does NOT change any existing keybinds, you will want to review your button bindings. There is a shiny new button binding selction GUI just for this.\r\n - You do not need 'Move Forward' bound to anything.\r\n - Things that require pressing the 'Move Forward' keybind will require touching the 'forward' area of the touchpad/joystick in this mode. This includes teleporting and grabbing with the left hand climbey claws.\r\n\r\nVive Controllers\r\n - Disables anything bound to 'swipes' on the left controller touchpad.\r\n - Does NOT disable actions bound to pressing in the 4 areas of the left touchpad, although you may want to just change them all to jump or sprint.\r\n\r\nTouch Controllers\r\n - Disables anything bound to joystick up/down/left/right on left controller. You need to relocate these bindings.\r\n - Does not check if you're 'touching' the joystick, let me know if it should (due to insufficent deadzone or something)\r\n\r\n### New keybinding menu\r\n - Select from full list of available actions instead of having to cycle thru them one by one, who designed that crap in the first place?\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n - Fix the mouse tutorial not going away",
