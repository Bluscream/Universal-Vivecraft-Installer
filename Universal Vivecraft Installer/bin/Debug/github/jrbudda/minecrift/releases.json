This means you can install the same version of Vivecraft multiple times with different options and not overwrite the one profile.\r\n - Modpack Directory - ticking this allows you to set the profile's 'Game Directory' during installation. This is the preferred way to play Vivecraft with a modpacks (such as from the FTB/Curse/Twitch launcher). Previously you would have to install Vivecraft and then edit the profile settings in the launcher, now it can be done during installation.\r\n\r\n### Onward-style joystick/touchpad analog movement:\r\n\r\nVR Settings > Locomotion Settings > Freemove Type > Set to 'Joy/Pad'\r\n\r\n - Does NOT change any existing keybinds, you will want to review your button bindings. There is a shiny new button binding selction GUI just for this.\r\n - You do not need 'Move Forward' bound to anything.\r\n - Things that require pressing the 'Move Forward' keybind will require touching the 'forward' area of the touchpad/joystick in this mode. This includes teleporting and grabbing with the left hand climbey claws.\r\n\r\nVive Controllers\r\n - Disables anything bound to 'swipes' on the left controller touchpad.\r\n - Does NOT disable actions bound to pressing in the 4 areas of the left touchpad, although you may want to just change them all to jump or sprint.\r\n\r\nTouch Controllers\r\n - Disables anything bound to joystick up/down/left/right on left controller. You need to relocate these bindings.\r\n - Does not check if you're 'touching' the joystick, let me know if it should (due to insufficent deadzone or something)\r\n\r\n### New keybinding menu\r\n - Select from full list of available actions instead of having to cycle thru them one by one, who designed that crap in the first place?\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Revision 2 (8/2/2017)</summary>\r\n\r\n - fix crash when not using forge.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Revision 3/4 (3/15/2018)</summary>\r\n\r\n - Update installer to support MultiMC 0.6.0+\r\n - Fix download link for mcp.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Revision 5 (4/9/2018)</summary>\r\n\r\n - Fix install failure when forge and shadersmod is checked.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Revision 6 (4/4/2019)</summary>\r\n\r\n - Update installer for MultiMC 0.6.3+\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Revision 7 (4/24/2019)</summary>\r\n\r\n - Fix build issue that may have been causing some mod incompatibility.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Revision 8 (2/11/2020)</summary>\r\n\r\n - Fix reference to maven url that no longer exists.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Revision 9 (7/29/2020)</summary>\r\n\r\n - Potential fix for Linux issues.\r\n</details>\r\n",

It does not include the climbeymotion items, sorry.\n\n## Mixed Reality!\n- This is all Techjar, thank him.\n- Added 4-pane unity style layout as option.\n- Added undistorted pass as option\n- Add alpha mask as option\n- Added 3rd controller support.\n\n## New Things\n- Added option to turn off 'animal touching' so you can slap pigs around again.\n- You can now bind actions to 'swiping' the Vive touchpads up, down, left or right. The hotbar next/prev commands that were on the left controller are now on the right. If you can't deal with that change, well, you can bind it back. The right touchpad up/down is still hardcoded to scrolling if a menu is open.\n- You can now bind actions to the Touch right joystick up, down, left and right. The right joystick up/down is still hardcoded to scrolling if a menu is open.\n- Added seated option to use crosshair direction instead of hmd as 'forward'\n- Added back crosshair scaling and crosshair size options.\n- Added option for seated HUD to follow crosshair instead of HMD.\n\n## Bug fixes\n- Fixed very fast button presses being ignored cause minecraft is slow. Thanks Techjar.\n- Fixed some menu's scrolling to the bottom using the touchpad.\n- Maybe workaround steamvr freezing up randomly.\n- Always change vertical offset when riding something. Fixes mod mounts.\n- Fix right click spam when touching an animal.\n- Fix game not starting with VRidge due to chaperone failure.\n\n## Update to OpenVR 1.0.5.\n\nIf you play 1.7.10 and 1.11.2 vivecraft be sure to update both.\n\n## New teleporter-water interaction\n- Teleporter now teleports you a block down into the water. \n- What happens after that depends on your Simulate Falling and Roomscale Swimming options.\n  - If Simulate Falling is off you will just sit there, otherwise you will sink and then:\n    - If roomscale swimming is ON you will sink to about your neck. you can roomscale swim or \n      teleport again.\n    - if roomscale swimming is OFF you will sink. Like a rock. Hold Jump to surface and teleport.\n- If your teleport arm is already under water, you can teleport to the bottom.\n\n## LiteLoader\n- Fixed a compatibility issue that was likely making liteloader mods malfunction.\n",

This means a 40 degree aim change for Touch controllers but at least it's now consistent. Tools with handles still sit parallel to the grip. Report any oddities.\n- Touch controllers can now bind actions to pushing the left joystick up, down, left or right.\n- Totally new set of Touch default controls, please review and/or reset your bindings.\n  - Swapped default right contoller A and Grip. Grip is now pick block, A is now 'Use'. This was reported to be more comfortable and is more like how the Vive does it.\n  - Right stick click now opens inventory\n  - Right stick left/right now cycles the hotbar.\n  - Left stick left/right defaults to 'Rotate Left' and 'Rotate Right' for 180 degree play.\n  - Left stick up is now jump by default.\n  - Left stick down is now sneak by default.\n  - Left stick click is now sprint by default.\n  - Left stick grip is now the player list (tab)\n  - left stick X is now open/close chat\n\n# Forge things\n- Added a really stupid workaround to maybe allow some Forge mod weapons to work like swords in roomscale\n\n# Other Things\n- fixed teleport destination not working if you were sneaking sometimes\n- Fixed world rotation + roomscale multiplier not working together (thank you  jpfx1342)\n- New, stronger, faster, better, first person attack/mine animation\n- First person hand skins no longer upside-down\n- Updated bow haptics to work like 1.11\n- Fixed in-game keyboard not working on menus\n",

(there is no rowing as boats in 1.7 do not have paddles. They move on willpower and happy thoughts alone)\n- Red tint at low health\n\nAlso updated to OpenVR 1.0.4. If you install this version, older versions of Vivecraft may no longer work without reinstalling them.\n\nA lot of code changes went into this, most of which did not want to go quietly across the 2+ year version differential. I expects bugs. You should expect bugs. In fact, go out and get a nice cheese spread, a couple bottles of wine and tidy up the house cause bugs are coming for dinner.\n\nAs always please use the Issues page here on github to report problems and they will be addressed based on a priority system to which only I am privy.\n",

The rotations might not be perfect but all items should now at least appear in the vicinity of where they should. Tested mainly with Tinker's Construct and LOTR. Report any that are wildly off.\n- Throwing and shooting mod items while moving should shoot in direction of the crosshair, not your movement direction.\n- Fixed UI in mixed reality cam.\n- Techjar has made the mousewheel use emulation for compatibility with Modular Powersuits\n- Fixed crash in LOTR achievements screen.\n- Found out that LOTR fast travel and map teleport cannot be bound to a button. Bind keyboard_press:F and M instead, or use the popup keyboard via left_grip+left_appmenu.\n- LOTR mod is pretty cool, you guys.\n- Fix misc Forge transparency issues in the inventory.\n- Fix main menu not working when you quit back to it.\n- Fixed particles not rendering\n",

Singleplayer Only. Techjar has updated his [Vivecraft Forge Extensions](http://ci.techjargaming.com/job/Vivecraft%20Forge%20Extensions/) plugin to make this radius configurable for VR players on Forge multiplayer servers.\n- Connecting to a non-vivecraft server will use /tp-command-based teleportation like Vivecraft 1.10 does.\n- Added logo to installer.

    "Body": "## Edit: Updated to 28r1 to fix the Malformed Class Name crash\n\n#### Seated Mode!\n\nYou can now play Vivecraft without getting up. Should be a nice break from chasing Pokemon around the neighborhood. Turn this mode on in the VR Settings Menu. Uses the keyboard and mouse. Note that I did the mode in the most minimially-disruptive way to the rest of the game which was designed around controllers. To that end, you will note, seated mode uses a pair of 'fake' controllers that float somewhere around your armpits, if you're lucky. \n    Things to note:\n         - You will always be in free move mode, regarless of setting.\n         - You will always be in hud-lock-to-head mode, regardless of setting.\n         - The virtual keyboard will not come up, no matter how hard you try.\n                 - You can change how high up you are with the World Scaling setting.\n         - You will find something you wish worked differently. You will look for an option. You will be disappointed .\n\nMy current policy towards Seated Mode is that you turn it on or off and that's it. It works like it works. Unless something is broken to the point of un-playablility or could be improved without needing an option my response to suggestions or complaints will be [...](http://www.freelargeimages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Grumpy_Cat_No_02.jpg)\n\nDo NOT change your SteamVR room setup. This is still technically a room-scale/standing game. If you want the chaperone bounds to go away set them to Developer.\n\n#### Mixed Reality cam improvements\n\nMore work was done to the mode that like, 4 whole people are going to use!.\n            - [MR cam mode works with the shadersmod versions.](https://i.gyazo.com/thumb/1200/_6e2b850e0f2db5a0d7f47ee9c8196073-gif.gif)\n                        - Added back the FOV slider for MR cam. Added hotkeys to change FOV.\n            - MR cam mode works with world rotation and scaling like it should, (I think.)\n            - The 'clipping plane' is now always vertical in the world, no matter how angled your camera is up or down.\n            - The virtual camera renders in the HMD as a black circle thing, so you can tell where it is.\n            - You can optionally turn off the rendering of the 'hands' in the MR cam (items still show up)\n\n#### Other things!\n- Techjar has finalized the java magic to make the LOTR mod work with Vivecraft. May also fix other Forge mod issues.\n- Techjar has also added an option to totally blank the HMD when your head is in a block instead of showing the block texture.\n- Added Overlay, Proiler, and Screenshot buttons to in-game menu since you can't seem to bind the F-keys to the controller.\n",

    "Body": "Wow. What a week. All kinds of nifty thingamajigs for you today!\n\nIn order of descending coolness:\n- **Added support for Mixed Reality!** This was a major team effort from me and Techjar. We put way more time into this than we should have but it works! Currently supports a fixed camera. If you want \"3rd-controller-camera\" support send me a 3rd controller. Actual instructions for setup can be found [here](http://www.vivecraft.org/mixed-reality-cam/). \n  - Also Techjar has added an 'undistorted' first person mirror mode, great for streamers. Does require an extra render of the game, however.\n- **Animal touching!** Great suggestion from a player: you can now 'interact' (right click) on passive animals just by touching them. This works for feeding, mounting, shearing, leashing... etc.\n  - You also cannot swing-hit an animal without a sword/tool. If you must punch a chicken to death, you will have to click it, like God intended.\n- **Buckets!** You can fill buckets by dipping them into liquid. You cannot pour them out without clicking tho. (I tried. Can't be done right., plus you'd wet yourself.)\n- **More FPS!** I put on my Zero Cool mask and hacked into Shadersmod so you can use the 'eye stencil' with shaders. I am assuming this gives the ~20% fps boost it should, but have not tested it at all.\n- **New interactive hotbar!** You can now select items from the hotbar by just touching them. Can be turned off in the options if you can't stop touching yourself.\n- **New hotbar mode!** Added a hotbar mode where it sits on the inside of your left arm and 'pops out' when you look at it. Also supports touching. Try it out by setting the 'hud lock' mode to 'wrist'.\n- **Faster Loading!** Techjar has done some sort of magic that makes the world load faster on startup! \n- **New Network API** Started on a consistent network API for server plugins to talk to Vivecraft. Should lead to some cool things in the future!\n- **Eye sync!** - Did some stuff so that even under low FPS you should no longer suffer 'eye-desync'\n- **Bugs!** - Likely added more bugs than were fixed, tell me all about them on the issues page!\n",

    "Body": "### Full shadersmod support!\n- Vivecraft 1.7.10 is now compatible with [karyonix's shadersmod](http://shadersmod.net/) both with and without Forge. \n  -  You do NOT need to install shadersmod yourself, just check the box in the installer and it will do it for you. (it won't hurt if you already have it, tho)\n  - You also have the option of installing Vivecraft with Forge only and putting shadersmod in your /mods folder. I handle the rest 'cause I'm basically a wizard.\n  - I've been playing with [Sildur's Vibrant Shaders Lite](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1291396-1-6-4-1-10-2-sildurs-shaders-pc-mac-intel-latest) and it's usable. I'm closer to min spec for VR so maybe someone out there on a supercomputer can run [SEUS](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1280299-sonic-ethers-unbelievable-shaders-v11-0)\n  - Eye stencil is disabled when shadersmod is running, sadly.\n- Getting shaders working took yet another major re-do of camera/rendering junk. It's actually halfway how I was planning on doing it for 1.10 and is a fantastic proof-of-concept. \n  - In celebration I have upped the maximum world scale to 100, because it's no longer glitchy up there.\n- Pinned the stars in the heavens. Because I am a wizard.\n- Clouds bow to my whim. Because wizard.\n- The sun, the moon and the sky know their place. (wizard).\n- Added a 'Free Rotate' button binding. It is exactly the same as Walkabout except it goes the other way.\n- Fixed startup crash if you're using a Rift. Apparently Vivecraft works on the Rift.\n",

Bind it to a button and have at it.\n- Added a \"Quick Commands\" menu. You can customize up to 12 different server \"/\" commands or chat messages in VR Settings > Quick Commands. View and send them from the in-game menu under 'Commands'.\n- Cleaned up the rendering and animation to remove all jitter and jank. The GUI, teleport arc, crosshair, mounts and all other thingamajigs should render smoothly as you jump and move around. If something jitters still please let me know.\n- Part of the cleanup involved nixing the little 'dash' animation when you teleport. Sorry if you liked it. You're welcome if you hated it.\n- Holding left_grip now counts as holding down Shift for menus and inventory screens. Thanks Techjar!\n- Begun work on supporting shadersmod with or without Forge. Not quite working yet but it's going to happen.\n- Lots of cleanup to the rendering code, fixed some Forge mod bugs, maybe increased performance when using Forge.\n- Fixed the slow-block-breaking thing that was happening to some folks.\n- Added more granularity to the World Scale slider between 0.5 and 2.0 so you can tweak it to suit your needs. If you're having trouble getting it back to 1.0 just hit the reset to defaults button.\n\nIf you use a Forge mod pack and find you can't move or click remove the NotEnoughKeys mod. It's not compatible.\n",

This does not disable swiping the left touchpad.\n- Disabled the 'Allow Crawling' options and removed all supporting code. This was a nice idea but ultimately was not compatible enough with multiplayer (and Forge apparently). Removing this should fix several of the recent positioning bugs. This feature may make a reappearance in the 1.10 version. Maybe.\n- Hopefully fixed teleporting into walls or falling off ledges right after a teleport.\n- Changed crosshair rendering to show an X if the thing you're pointing at is out of range_. (_results not guaranteed)\n- Fixed being able to break your boat by swinging at it.\n- Changed a bunch of code around related to movement while riding on things... I think it's all working ok I just hope I didn't break anything. The thing you're riding has some janky animation but that seems to be it.\n- Fixed horse inventory closing immediately sometimes.\n- Techjar has added some code to simulate mouse clicks better for Forge mod compatibility. This only occurs when the window has focus. Also added a warning message if you try to use the keyboard and the game window does not have focus. Thanks TJ.\n- In-game keyboard can always be opened with left_grip+left_app_menu combo even if you have re-bound the grip to something else.\n",

Just run the installer. \n- Fixed a few outstanding bugs from v21 yesterday including bows not working in muliplayer, and boats/horses not steering correctly.\n- Fixed up the minecraft Profiler to provide more information pertinent to OpenVR. Hitting shift-F3 will bring up a nice pie chart of where all your frames are spending their time. If you have really bad stuttering this may help narrow down the cause.\n- Used profiler to significantly improve performance for everyone. Or maybe not, might depend on your GPU I only have the one to test Please post results.\n",

    "Body": "Well it's been a while, hasn't it? How have you been? Me? Oh I've been here, gutting reams of code and twirling vectors round and round to bring you this latest update to Vivecraft. And oh boy, it's a doozy. I've re-implemented OpenVR roomscale into Minecraft almost from scratch. Every little bit of code that relied on the HMD or controller position/direction had to change. Why you ask? Well dear friends, to bring you:\n\n### WORLD SCALING\n\nTry it. Don't even read the description. Stop. Install the mod and go into VR Settings and play with the World Scale slider. Come back and thank me. Please note this is mostly cosmetic at this point. Your 'body' is still the same size and on the ground at your feet. There's a lot of hurdles to getting this sort of thing working as a gameplay element while being multiplayer and mod compatible. For now, enjoy the view.\n\n### WORLD ROTATION\n\nYou now have the ability to rotate the world around your room in 45 degree increments.This was requested many times and I'm happy it finally functions. Took a LOT of work. You can do this from the VR Settings menu, by pressing the left or right arrow keys on your keyboard, or binding the 'Rotate Left' or 'Rotate Right' function to your controller buttons.\n- Please note: the 2 changes above necessitated an unprecedented amount of code overhaul. Previously working things may now be broken and other things may be broken in new ways unheard of before. Please let me know what's not working, especially the HUD/GUI Menu stuff I didn't test most of the options.\n\n### OTHER THINGS!\n- Fixed Forge mods not responding to button mappings. If it still won't work try binding the keyboard key to 'keyboard(press) or 'keyboard'(hold). Confirmed that Gilby's prox chat requires you to bind keyboard(hold) V. The speak command doesn't work.\n- Fixed not being able to set the key when mapping a controller button to a keyboard button\n- Fixed various rendering issues.\n- Tweaked the swinging attack.\n- <sup><sub>added back the Quick Torch command - bind it yourself</sub></sup>\n- So many other little things I can't even.\n",

    "Body": "- Put some quality time into the 'manual swinging' attack. I think it feels better. \n  - The conditions for hitting a block are a little looser, you should make impact more often.\n  - You can hold a tool in front of you and run though a field chopping down all the grass. Wheee.\n  - You have extended reach for hitting monsters and animals with tools. Swords have a little bit more reach than tools. You can still hit from further away via clicking but if you're hardcore you'll unbind the attack button.\n  - Be careful running around with a sword, you'll hurt someone.\n  - All still under development, subject to change. Please provide feedback.\n- Added 2 new options:\n  - You can turn off the Stencil Mask in Stereo Rendering Options\n  - You can turn off the Blue Circle Buddy(tm) in Locomotion Options. You shouldn't do this, you will lose your Blue Circle Buddy(tm)\n- Connecting to multiplayer server not running a Vive plugin will disable switching to teleport mode via the right_grip button.\n- Fixed sunsets. again.\n- Keyboard opens automatically when editing a sign or book. Thanks Techjar.\n- Other minor Forge compatibility fixes courtesy of Techjar.\n- If you subscribe to the SteamVR beta channel, you will notice SteamVR launches itself now if it's not running when you fire up Vivecraft. That's a thing they did and I can't do anything about it.\n",

This also allows re-re-implementing the inventory transparency fix.\n\n#### Big Multiplayer compatibility update.\n\nIn an effort to make ViveCraft play similarly on single- and multi-player I've removed changes to a lot of the 'core' shared files used by the local server when you play singleplayer. What this means is some of the neat little features that previously only worked in singleplayer are sadly gone, but multiplayer should now work a lot more like would be expected. This has almost certainly added bugs (I had to fix _sunsets_, of all things) so please let me know in the issues if the game does something weird.\n- Important notes as result of these changes:\n  - Fixes crash with Terrafirmacraft.\n  - \"Allow Crawling\" now defaults to off. It was causing 'in wall' damage when you jump and hit your head. Leave it off for multiplayer and use it in single player at your own risk.\n  - Had to make some changes to 'Player Inertia', especially when flying. It now only applies to the horizontal directions when you're on the ground, flying and water have their own inertia that was causing... issues. Let me know if it needs tweaking.\n  - Dropped items spawn at your face again not hand, sorry, the server spawns these and has no idea where your hand is \n    :(\n    - Other projectiles will spawn at your hand on singleplayer but face in multiplayer, for now.\n\n#### Big Rendering update.\n- Fixed up the \"Render Scale\" and \"FSAA\" options to ... do things. You can now scale the game from 50% to 400% of the native HMD resolution to suit your performance or quality needs. The FSAA settings is really just fancy downsample filtering and should be turned on if using render scales > 1. I find render scale of 1.5 and FSAA on goes a long way to eliminate 'tree shimmer'.\n- Vivecraft now uses the Vive's \"Stencil Mask\". This cuts out rendering the parts of the game not visible in the HMD. It's about 30% of the screen so that should translate directly into FPS increases. Note that minecraft is single-threaded and heavily cpu-bound so this may not mean improvements for everyone.\n- Fixed display mirroring settings misbehaving.\n\n#### Other stuff that doesn't qualify as Big\n- Horses are working OK. I think.\n- Fixed r_controller scrollwheel cycling inventory\n- Fixed controller buttons double mapping? maybe?\n",

Ya know what just go play Longbow in the The Lab, it works like that.\n- Draw length scales with player height, let me know how it feels.\n- Haptic feedback for those lonely nights\n- Doubled arrow damage because you will miss.\n- Critical shots still activate based on how long you're had the bow drawn, which was unintentional but ok with me.\n- Did not test with multiplayer, may produce unexpected results.\n\nArchery P.A.Q. (potentially asked questions)\n- Is it as awesome as it sounds?\n  - yes.\n- Can I turn it off and use bows like before?\n  - no.\n- Will I ever be able to turn it off and use bows like before, like as an option?\n  - maybe.\n- The arrow is rotated wrong in my right hand.\n  -  This is texture pack dependent. I had it all nice and set up for Choma hills and then loaded vanilla and it was off. Sorry not much I can do, it's rotated for stock arrow textures now.\n- My arm is sore and tired.\n  -  This is not a question.\n\nOther notes: Implementing archery required practically gutting the hand/item rendering code. A lot of items might now not appear correctly in your hands or animate like they should, let me know about them in the issues, i certainly didn't check them all. Also vectors make my brain hurt.\n\n#### Other fixes\n- Fully depressing a trigger until it clicks is now its own button, currently left_trigger_click activates sprint.\n- Fixed installer not setting launcher profile jar correctly.\n- Fixed camera when riding something in teleport mode.\n- Broke and then fixed forge like 6 times. \n",

Valve: if you're listening: get your act together.\n- Updated JOpenVR accordingly, which is the java wrapper around OpenVR, from phr00t's JMonkey repo. You should check that out if you want to write a VR game in java from scratch.\n- Used all this newfangled tech to make the keyboard work as expected. Only issue is it draws on top of things that it should be behind, but that's cause it has no idea what the game is rendering cause it's injected from SteamVR. To fix would have to implement my own keyboard screen, and that's just... SO many buttons.\n- Added a 'Chat' button to the main menu, this is how you should get to chat rather than hitting T cause of the above drawing issue. It'll position the windows better. You may want to unbind chat from T altogether.\n- L_grip + L_AppMenu still brings up the in game keyboard so you can hit keys for mods or whatever.\n- Chat window stays pinned to the world when you hit enter, won't close back to your hand til you hit app menu again or click off it.\n- Main menu and inventory screen now pop up in your field of view instead of in front of your left hand.\n- Fixed un-sneaking causing you to bounce up in the air 3 times. Don't ask. (taking suggestions on how to indicate sneaking)\n",

    "Body": "- A nice person named OmegaJak went and implemented the SteamVR keyboard into minecrift-vive about a month ago and just left the code lying around on github for anyone to see. So I've adapted it. It's bad, like, real bad. Open/SteamVR is super under-baked and the java wrapper has significant limitations. I've followed his approach which is sorta the only way to go. The SuperJank(tm) jankytime fun keyboard works in the following way: (you may need SteamVR running)\n  \n  -- If you click (with the controller) on any text field like in the main menu the keyboard should pop up. You will not understand why it popped up WHERE it did but that is expected.\n  -- It's works better for text fields, simply use the keyboard like normal and what you type should mirror in the game. When you're done, click done on the keyboard.\n  -- If you're in-game and want to press a key, hold down the l_grip button (sneak) and press the left app menu button (that normally opens the game menu). This will pop up the keyboard.\n  -- You can now press keys. They will remain showing on the keyboard itsself but only the most recent one should be sent to the game.\n  -- If you hit T or \\ the chat window ill pop up (somewhere). Here's where things get jankier. You can't press enter. Well you can, but it will make the keyboard go away and it will not send your chat message.\n  \n  **To send a chat message you have to hit , (comma) instead of enter**\n  \n  -- This is a workaround because I'm totally unable to detect when enter or done is pressed on the openvr keyboard.\n- I do plan on making the keyboard and chat window location a little more sensical in the future.\n\nAlso hopefully unbroke Forge, this is just one battle what will be a long war.\n",

You have at least this much or you can't run VR.\n- Re-did a lot of keybind code (again) for maximal compatibility and imminent key rebinding possibilities.\n  - Both touchpads are now technically split into 4 buttons each with the mappings as in the documentaion, let me know if this causes any weirdness.\n- Dropping items is now more like throwing them, try it, its fun (r_app_button)\n- Disabled 'hud-scale' option for now cause it was screwing with the mouse cursor position. Fixed other bugs related to that.\n- You can now close the inventory screen like 6 different ways: left touchpad button, left trigger, or either right controller button with the cursor pointed the other way.\n- Added some haptics, but I think I forgot to finish it and it only goes off when you hurt yourself.\n- teleport beam is kinda transparent now.\n\ndid I mention\n\n# FORGE IS WORKING\n",

I did not test it but there is a check for invalid heights in vanilla. It'll be an option when i get around to options.\n- Bumped down the teleport food consumption a little.\n- Fixed not being able to control the mouse if the controllers are off.\n",

Inventory button is still a little janky not sure why.\n- Improved arc teleport. It will now teleport you exactly to the aim location instead of the middle of the block (unless you would collide with terrain). The little pink circle also now shows the exact position you will arrive at. Made the beam a little \n  darker. Both play modes now default to Arc because I think it's nicer and faster.\n- Arrows, throw-able items and fireballs now originate at the right controller instead of your face.\n- Increased trigger activation to 25%. sjw's beware.\n- Other stuff I'm probably forgetting.\n",

Kind have to play with it due to the inertia  setting minecrift introduced.\n- First pass at balancing arc teleport. (this will all be optional eventually)\n  - No changes to length or cooldown yet.\n  - In survival mode, can only teleport if the arc lands on the top surface of most blocks. You should easily be able to climb 1 block standing next to it, 2 blocks if you're tall enough. \n  - Ladders can be teleported onto. (little buggy still, but climbing is possible)\n- Probably maybe fixed boats and carts.\n",
